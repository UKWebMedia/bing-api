 * Defines a metropolitan area demographic report request, which shows the overall effectiveness and cost of running ads in the different geographical locations, for example countries and regions, states, and metropolitan areas for a specified time period. You can include details in the report, for example clicks and spend that you can use to identify geographical locations where you ads are performing well, and those areas where you may need to adjust your strategy. The report also identifies the physical location of the user and the intended geographical location of the user's search query, for example a user in Seattle searching for services in Portland.
